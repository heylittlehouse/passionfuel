lovers who despite incredible odds, stayed true to each other through nothing but

love letters during the Vietnam war. It&#39;s also a true story of the people who raised

me: My grandparents.<br/><br/>

My grandparents met in the 50&#39;s and became high school sweethearts. When my

grandfather joined the army after graduation, it put their love for each other to the

test. Being immediately sent to boot camp and subsequently shipped out to aid in

the conflict in Vietnam forced my grandfather to find a way to communicate with the

love of his life despite the distance &minus; This is when he wrote his first letter,

For several years, these letters were my grandparents only form of communication.

Having lost my parents at a young age, my grandparents took me in. Seeing how

affected I was by my parents passing, my grandmother gave me the letters the

illustrate the kind of love that built the family I come from. Many kids have their

favorite books, but my earliest memories of enjoying myself reading are of these

letters.<br/><br/>

The only thing my grandparents loved as much as each other was going to the

movies. This was evident in their letters by how much they would gush over the

latest releases they&#39;d seen. Seeking out the movies mentioned in my grandparents

letters is where my own love of the movies was born.</p>
